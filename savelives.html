        <p>The website <a href="https://www.1milliondogs.com">1milliondogs.com </a> was created to help dogs in shelters and to promote dogecoin.</p>
        <p>50% of the proceeds go to dog shelters.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, many people do not know, but if the dog doesn't get adopted within 72 hours and the shelter is full, it will be euthanized.</p>
        <p>When it comes to the cost to adopt a dog, there's no accurate answer. Rates can be very different, with shelter staff reporting fees anywhere from $50 to $350. Animal shelters are inherently stressful places. </p>
